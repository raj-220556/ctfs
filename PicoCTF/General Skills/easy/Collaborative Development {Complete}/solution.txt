Description:
	My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work 					together?
	You can download the challenge files here:
	-challenge.zip
	
Solution :
	=> Reference By PicoPrimer.
	
	Concept:
		-> TeamWork Using Git.
	Process:
		Step 1: Downloaded Source File
		     $ wget "https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/178/challenge.zip"
		     
		Step 2: Unziped challenge.zip
		     $ unzip challenge.zip
		
		Step 3: It Contains Folder drop-in Folder. drop-in contains flag.py
		     -> Checked the file it contains Information "print("Printing the flag...")"
		
		Step 4: Checking Git saving Points.
		     $ git log
		     ->There is no Previous saving points
		    
		Step 5: Checking git Branches
		    => Branches which are other team members are Working with Project
		     $ git branch
		       feature/part-1
		       feature/part-2
		       feature/part-3
		     * main
		    // There are 3 other branches of working with project
		    
		Step 6: Switch with branches By using $ git checkout <branch>
		     $ git checkout feature/part-1
		       Switched to branch 'feature/part-1'
		       
		Step 7: Read the flag.py File
		     $ cat flag.py
		       print("Printing the flag...")
		       print("picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_", end='')
		
		Step 8: Repeat Steps 6 & 7 with other branches "feature/part-2" & "feature/part-3"
		     For feature/part-2 :
		        $ cat flag.py
		          print("Printing the flag...")
			  print("m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_", end='')
			  
		     For feature/part-3 :
		        $ cat flag.py
		          print("Printing the flag...")
			  print("w0rk_6c06cec1}")
			  
	        Finally : Combine Flag.
	
	Flag : picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_w0rk_6c06cec1}
	

Summary : 
 => Learned Git Branches 
 => Switching Git Branches with $ git checkout <branch>
 
Drawback :
 => Merging of Git Branches I can't Done 
 => Learn Once Merging of git Branches
